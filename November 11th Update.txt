October 15th-Nov 6th - Received NFC Tags from amazon.Began to establish how to implement the idea for my aplication.Researched
differnt methods for app development and Identified Android studio as the platform to build my app on.Installed android studio on my laptop and tried
to get an understanding of how it worked as I had never come across it before.

Nov 8th- Began to start on my own app by building a log in page including a username and password.
Once this is is functional on my smartphone I will begin looking at how to read NFC Tags from it.
